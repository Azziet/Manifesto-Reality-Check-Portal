# Manifesto-Reality-Check-Portal
To analyze the performance of the ruling party and decide whether to vote same party or not.

#Problem
For all democratic countries where political parties declare their manifesto before the election at the assembly level, parliament level, country level. When any ruling party gets elected then they serve for fixed no. of years.

But people of the assembly/parliament/country can not visualize/identify the performance of ruling party across the 5 years of rule in a tangible way.

#Solution
1. This portal will analyze the performance against the promises made in a manifesto by the ruling party by collecting the data provided by the inhabitants of all areas (assembly/parliament etc).

2. End Users can select the City and Area - then It will display the ruling party name then all the problems exist in that area along with promises made in the manifesto for that area. End users can enter the progress and tick against the point.

3. There will be an algorithm that will analyze the rating against the promise/problem if its rating crosses 75% then Portal will mark this promise/problem as Complete.

4. On the basis of inputs/problem/promises End users can see the performance of any Ruling party in specific are or country.
